            Sloths, of the families Megalonychidae and Bradypodidae (two-toed and three-toed, respectively) are distant relations of anteaters, and make their homes in the jungles of Central and South America. They are known for their chill, slow-moving attitudes, and, spoiler alert (!) they're adorable.

            Sloths make me so happy! I can just look at pictures of them all day and imagine that the are moving very, very, very slowly. It's like watching sloth videos without all that bandwidth. Sloths remind me of folks I know. Some folks move slow and are cute. The more folks recognize that sloths are a perfectly good animal, the happier I'll be.

            <ul class="list">
                <li>Sloths are clumsy on land but are great swimmers.</li>
                <li>Sloths are arboreal animals, so they spend most of their time in trees.</li>
                <li>Sloths only urinate/defecate once a week.</li>
                <li>Contrary to their reputation, sloths only sleep about 10 hours a day.</li>
                <li>Sloths defecate and urinate at the same place every time and because of this they are vulnerable to predators.</li>
                <li>Algae grow on their fur, which camouflages them green.</li>
                <li>Sloths diets consist mostly of leaves which gives them minimal energy and nutrition.</li>
                <li>Slothsâ€™ primary predators include eagles, snakes, and jaguars.</li>
